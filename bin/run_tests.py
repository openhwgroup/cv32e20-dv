Run the cleaned-up directed test-programs (C and assembly) on a CV32E20
testbench and print a pass/fail summary.  Either testbench can be selected
with --tb:

    core   the Verilator core testbench in sim/core            (default)
    uvmt   the UVM testbench in sim/uvmt, run with SIMULATOR=vsim

For each selected test the script invokes `make test TEST=<name> ...` in the
chosen testbench's sim directory, then parses the per-test log it leaves behind
for the verdict banner:

    core : sim/core/simulation_results/<name>/<run>/test_program/<name>.log
           "ALL TESTS PASSED"   -> PASS   (tb/core/tb_top.sv)
           "TEST(S) FAILED!"    -> FAIL

    uvmt : sim/uvmt/vsim_results/<cfg>/<name>/<run>/vsim-<name>.log
           "SIMULATION PASSED"  -> PASS   (tb/uvmt/uvmt_cv32e20_tb.sv;
                                           includes "PASSED with WARNINGS")
           "SIMULATION FAILED"  -> FAIL

Anything else (no banner, build error, timeout) is reported as ERROR.
The process exit code is 0 only if every test that was run reported PASS.

corev-dv tests (see COREV_DV_TESTS below) additionally need `make corev-dv`
run once beforehand to clone and compile the corev-dv/riscv-dv packages
(uvmt only). Whenever the selected set includes any corev-dv test, this
script runs `make corev-dv` itself before running any tests, and aborts if
that setup step fails.

For corev-dv tests, --run-index also selects which generated program directory
is used: run_test() passes it through as both RUN_INDEX (where the build/run
step looks for the program) and GEN_START_INDEX (where gen_corev-dv writes it).
run_test() also passes SEED=random for every corev-dv test, so each invocation
uses a fresh RNDSEED (mk/uvmt/uvmt.mk derives it from `date +%N`) for both the
corev-dv generator and the env-level randomization -- re-running the same
--run-index does NOT reproduce the same generated program/stimulus anymore.
The actual seed used is recorded in that run's vsim-<name>.log header
(`-sv_seed <value>`) for later replay via SEED=<value>.

Usage
-----
The script needs no arguments and can be run from anywhere (paths are resolved
relative to its own location in <repo>/bin).  A working RISC-V toolchain plus
the relevant simulator (Verilator for core, Questa vsim for uvmt) must be on
PATH, as for a normal `make test`.

    # Run the full self-checking set (C + assembly) on the core TB:
    bin/run_tests.py
    python3 bin/run_tests.py                    # equivalent

    # Run the same set on the UVM testbench (vsim), plus UVMT_TESTS (directed
    # tests that only make sense under uvmt, e.g. nmi_test):
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt
    # (equivalent to `make test TEST=<name> SIMULATOR=vsim` per test; the
    #  script sets SIMULATOR=vsim for you, so no need to export it yourself.)

    # Run only specific tests (by directory name under tests/programs/custom):
    bin/run_tests.py fibonacci misalign
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt hello-world

    # Also run the parked tests (step-compare / debug; meaningful under --tb uvmt):
    bin/run_tests.py --include-parked
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt --include-parked

    # Also run the passing corev-dv generated regression tests (uvmt only):
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt --include-corev-dv

    # Run ONLY the corev-dv generated regression tests (uvmt only):
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt --corev-dv-only

    # Skip simulation; just re-summarize logs from a previous run:
    bin/run_tests.py --parse-only
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt --parse-only

    # Run up to 4 tests concurrently (uvmt only is verified safe -- see below):
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt --corev-dv-only --jobs 4

    # Replay a specific prior corev-dv run from its logged seeds (gen_corev-dv
    # and test are independent UVM environments/vsim invocations, each with
    # their own seed -- see the summary table's GEN_SEED/RUN_SEED columns):
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt --gen-seed 363891135 --run-seed 354410829 \
        corev_rand_instr_and_data_stalls

    # Collect code coverage (uvmt only; equivalent to `make test ... COV=1` per test):
    bin/run_tests.py --tb uvmt --cov hello-world

    # Run in tandem with the Spike ISS, comparing every retired instruction
    # (core only; equivalent to `make test ... SPIKE_TANDEM=1` per test; see
    # docs/spike-tandem.md):
    bin/run_tests.py --spike-tandem

    # Run the ACT4 compliance-ELF sweep (core only; equivalent to
    # `make certify` in sim/core) instead of the named test set:
    bin/run_tests.py --certify

    # Same, but with every compliance ELF checked against Spike in tandem
    # (equivalent to `make certify SPIKE_TANDEM=1`):
    bin/run_tests.py --certify --spike-tandem

    # Narrow the certify sweep to one extension subdirectory (passed through
    # as FILTER=... to `make certify`; see sim/core/Makefile):
    bin/run_tests.py --certify --filter rv32i/Zicsr

    # Other options:
    #   --cfg NAME      uvmt config subdirectory                (default: default)
    #   --run-index N   RUN_INDEX subdirectory                  (default: 0)
    #   --gen-seed SEED corev-dv generator SEED ('random' or a literal value)
    #   --run-seed SEED test-step SEED ('random' or a literal value)
    #   --timeout SECS  per-test timeout                        (default: 1800)
    #   --jobs N, -j N  run up to N tests concurrently           (default: 1)
    #   --cov           collect code coverage (uvmt only)
    #   --spike-tandem  run in tandem with Spike, comparing every retired
    #                   instruction (core only; see docs/spike-tandem.md).
    #                   Builds Spike via `make spike_lib` first if needed --
    #                   can take several minutes the first time.
    #   --certify       run the ACT4 compliance-ELF sweep (`make certify`,
    #                   core only) instead of the named test set; combine
    #                   with --spike-tandem to certify in tandem with Spike
    #   --filter PATH   narrow --certify to one extension subdirectory
    #                   (passed through as FILTER=PATH to `make certify`)
    #   --quiet         suppress per-test simulation banners
    #   -h / --help     full option help

Exit status is 0 only when every selected test PASSED, so the script is
suitable for use as a CI gate.

Concurrency (--jobs)
--------------------
By default (--jobs 1) each test runs its own `make test`/`make gen_corev-dv
test`, which recompiles the design every time (VSIM_RUN_PREREQ=opt unless
COMP=NO is passed). Running that concurrently would race multiple vlog/vopt
invocations against the same shared vsim work library
(sim/uvmt/vsim_results/<cfg>/work) -- a previously-confirmed hazard (lock
contention or "already an optimized design" errors).

With --jobs > 1 and --tb uvmt, this script instead compiles the design ONCE
up front (`make comp`, serialized, in addition to the existing one-time `make
corev-dv` setup for corev-dv tests) and then passes COMP=NO to every test in
the parallel batch, so workers only run `vsim` against the already-compiled
design. If --cov is also given, that one-time compile is done with COV=1 too
(otherwise the shared design has no +cover instrumentation and every
worker's .ucdb ends up with assertions/covergroups but zero statement/
branch/condition coverage, since COMP=NO skips each worker's own vopt) --
each worker runs in its own per-test/run-index run directory
(sim/uvmt/vsim_results/<cfg>/<test>/<run_index>/), which `make`'s `run`
target `vmap`s back to the shared read-only compiled library. Many `vsim`
processes reading one compiled snapshot concurrently is a standard, safe
regression-farm pattern; it's concurrent *compilation* that isn't safe.

Caveat: the corev-dv random-program *generation* step (gen_corev-dv) itself
runs vsim from within a directory shared by all corev-dv tests
(vsim_results/<cfg>/corev-dv/), unlike the isolated per-test run directories
above. This looks benign under concurrency (per-test/idx log files don't
collide, and the shared `vmap` writes identical content regardless of which
process wins the race) but has not been independently stress-tested at high
--jobs counts. Keep an eye on it if you push --jobs high for corev-dv-heavy
batches.

--tb core (Verilator) has NOT been verified race-free under --jobs > 1: `make
test` for the core TB also recompiles into a shared directory
(sim/core/cobj_dir) on every invocation, and no COMP=NO-equivalent skip-flag
was found for it. Prefer --jobs 1 there unless you've confirmed otherwise.

Also keep the vsim license pool in mind (`lmutil lmstat`) -- each concurrent
uvmt worker holds its own set of Questa feature licenses (msimhdlsim,
svverification, mtiverification, ...) for the duration of its run.
